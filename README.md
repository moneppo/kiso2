App runtime for yet unnamed OS project. Consider this more like notes on my ideas for an OS platform, rather than actual working code.

* JVM as virtual machine
* Page structure & styling as YAML
* Any language can be action
* App is a manifest with versions
* Can be loaded on the fly or cached locally
* Offline First network interaction semantics
